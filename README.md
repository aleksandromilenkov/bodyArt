This is React application for gym named "Body Art"  based in Sveti Nikole, Macedonia.
The app is made for searching exercises, watch gifs and  videos of how to do those exercises, read about the exercises for all body parts.
I'm using Material UI for the styling, I'm fetching the data from Rapid API.
You can check the app hosted live on netlify here: https://bodyart-svetinikole.netlify.app/
